# text-adventure
A place to submit your own (or edit other peoples') text adventure games in any language!

You can submit whatever you want as long as it's some kind of interactive text adventure game.
Feel free to edit and add on to other people's code too!

## How to Contribute
### Step 1: Fork the repository

Click the "Fork" icon in the top right to fork the repository.

### Step 2: Upload/edit your text adventure game

#### FOR ADDING YOUR OWN GAME, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

Make a folder in the forked repository.
Name the folder like this, replacing spaces with '-'.

`text-adventure-game`

Place your text adventure game inside the folder, and format the file name the same way too:

`text-adventure-game.py` 

This is just an example, it doesn't have to be python - use any language you want!


#### FOR EDITING SOMEBODY ELSE'S GAME, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the folder of whichever text game you'd like to edit.

Copy and paste the game inside so that there are two copies of them and add the version number at the end of the one you're editing:

`other-adventure-game-v2.py`

If you're editing a version that has already been edited, add the sub-version number of that version to the end:

`other-adventure-game-v2-2.py`

Once you've edited or added what you want, move on to the next step.

### Step 3: Commit your changes and submit a pull request

Please explain what you want to add in the pull request title, like so:

`"Add text-adventure-game"`

or

`"Add other-adventure-game-v2"`

### And you're done! Your pull request should show up on the Hacktoberfest 2019 website.
