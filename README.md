# text-adventure
A place to submit your own (or edit other peoples') text adventure games in any language!

You can submit whatever you want as long as it's some kind of interactive text adventure game.
Feel free to edit and add on to other people's code too!

## How to Contribute
### Step 1: Fork the repository

Click the "Fork" icon in the top right to fork the repository.

### Step 2: Make a folder in the repository and upload your text adventure game to it.

Name the folder like this, replacing spaces with '-'. 
`text-adventure-game`

Format the file name the same way too:
`text-adventure-game.py` (This is just an example, it doesn't have to be python - use any language you want!)
